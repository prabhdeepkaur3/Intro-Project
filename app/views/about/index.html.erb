                <p class="card-text">The data I am planning to utilize encompasses the relationships between students, courses, and teachers within an educational institution. The structure of this data is organized into four key tables: Student, Course, Teacher, and Grade. 

                In the Student table, each student is represented with a unique identifier (st_id), along with their name, email address, and the grade they belong to (grade_id). Additionally, each student is associated with one or more courses through the course_id field.
                
                The Course table contains information about each course offered by the institution. Each course is identified by a unique identifier (course_id) and includes its name (course_name) as well as the identifier of the teacher(s) responsible for teaching it (teacher_id).
                
                The Teacher table lists all the teachers involved in the educational process. Each teacher has a unique identifier (teacher_id), along with their name (teacher_name). Furthermore, each teacher is associated with the courses they teach through the course_id field.
                
                Lastly, the Grade table stores information about the grades achieved by students in various courses. Each grade entry is identified by a unique identifier (grade_id) and includes the student identifier (st_id), the course identifier (course_id), and the grade obtained (grade).
                
                These tables are interconnected through their identifiers, establishing relationships that allow for comprehensive analysis of the educational ecosystem. By ensuring consistency in these identifiers across different datasets, data integration becomes seamless, enabling efficient analysis and insights extraction from disparate sources.</p>
